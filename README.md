Implementation of the Hungarian Method in C
===========================================

**This is a forked version from [Hungarian-Algorithm-in-C-Language](https://github.com/mohammadusman/Hungarian-Algorithm-in-C-Language).**

This algorithm allows you to find the minimum weight matching of a bipartite graph. The graph can be of arbitrary size and connectedness. The edge weights are captured by a MxN weight matrix where an infinite(Inf) weight designates that that pair of vertices given by that position are not connected.
